      <p>Evapotranspiration (ET) is the flux of water from the Earth's surface to the atmosphere. It comprises evaporation as well as transpiration, 
        which describes water's movement through a plant and its subsequent evaporation from plant surfaces. ET affects water availability and can be an indicator 
        of vegetation health. Using isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen, we conducted end-member splitting analysis (Kirchner and Allen, 2020) whichs determines how 
        watershed inputs are split into outputs. Figure 1 shows an example of a figure describing the long-term average partitioning (data are 
        fabricated since manuscript is in preparation for publication). We were specifically interested in how the fraction of ET sourced from summer precipitation
        varies with summer precipitation amount. However, this method relies on several assumptions that 
        make it unsuitable for analyzing data at the annual timescale.   
        </p>

    <section>
      <p>The end-member splitting method assumes that all inputs and outputs are accounted for. This becomes problematic at annual timescales because we don't know how much precipitation 
        from previous years is supplying runoff in a given year. One way of addressing this is to examine the results under a variety of contradicting assumption and look for consistent trends
        as shown in figure 3. However, trends are rarely consistent and this becomes difficult to interpret. Furthermore, this approach ignores another key assumption: that there is no change
        in storage during the sampling period which, in this case, is one year.

          the year of interested are used to calculate the y-axis value. "Lag 1" means that precipitation isotope values from the previous year are used to calculate the y-axis value. "Mean" 
          means that the long-term average precipitation isotope values are used to calculate the y-axis value. Data are fabricated.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      </p>
      <p>Another option is to group years by the amount of summer precipitation and analyze differences between the groups. By grouping
        multiple years, we can assume that changes in storage are negligible compared to total flux amounts. We calculate the weighted 
        average isotope signatures for each group before calculating the partitioning fractions, so we aren't assuming that all inputs 
        or outputs are confined to a single year. However, this method doesn't show how partitioning changes over a range of values and 
        we were unable to detect many statistically significant differences between the two groups.

      <p>To solve this problem, we developed a bootstrapping numerical solution analysis. To find a numerical solution, we replaced every 
        variable in the end-member splitting equations with the linear regression equation of that variable against the x-axis (either 
        summer of winter precipitation). We conducted bootstrapping by repeating this process with a random sample of the data. We conducted 
        3000 bootstrapping iterations and used the percentiles from those iterations to create the figure below.
