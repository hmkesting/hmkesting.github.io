      <h1>Booststrapping and Numerical Solution Analysis</h1>

      <p>Evapotranspiration (ET) is the flux of water from the surface to the atmosphere. It includes evaporation as well as transpiration, 
        which is water that is taken up by plants and then lost through leaf surfaces. ET affects water availability and can be an indicator 
        of vegetation health. For this analysis, we focused on the seasonal sourcing of ET from precipitation that falls during summer 
        (May - September) versus winter (October - April). Figure 1 shows the long-term average partitioning (data are fabricated since manuscript is in preparation for publication). Specifically, we asked how annual 
        fluxes of water from summer and winter precipitation to ET vary depending on summer precipitation amounts. Using isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen, we 
        conducted end-member splitting analysis (Kirchner and Allen, 2020). However, this method relies on several assumptions that 
        make it unsuitable for analyzing data at the annual timescale.   
        </p>
      <p>The end-member splitting method assumes that all inputs and outputs are accounted for. This becomes problematic at annual timescales because we don't know how much precipitation 
        from previous years is supplying runoff in a given year. One way of addressing this is to examine the results under a variety of contradicting assumption and look for consistent trends.

        <figcaption><b>Figure 2.</b>Plots of the fraction of evapotranspiration sourced from summer precipitation under several assumptions. "Lag 0" means that precipitation isotope values from 
          the year of interested are used to calculate the y-axis value. "Lag 1" means that precipitation isotope values from the previous year are used to calculate the y-axis value. "Mean" 
          means that the long-term average precipitation isotope values are used to calculate the y-axis value. Data are fabricated.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>To solve this problem, we developed a bootstrapping numerical solution analysis. To find a numerical solution, we replaced every 
        variable in the end-member splitting equations with the linear regression equation of that variable against the x-axis (either 
        summer of winter precipitation). We conducted bootstrapping by repeating this process with a random sample of the data. We conducted 
        3000 bootstrapping iterations and used the percentiles from those iterations to create the figure below.

      <h1>Sediment Transport Analysis for Road Decomissioning in Sequoia National Forest</h1>
      <figure>

      <p>The Geomorphic Roads and Inventory Package is used by the U.S. Forest Service to model sediment transport as a function of 
        topography, road condition, vegetation, and other variables. I used this framework to develop a similar analysis using data 
        collected on Survey123. I also used a DEM, a roads layer, and a stream network layer. This map shows which roads are likely
        delivering the most sediment. Additionally, it also shows which streams are accumulating the most sediment. This map was 
        used by the Forest Service to inform decisions about road decomissioning to reduce sediment delivery to streams.
