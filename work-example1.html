      <p>Evapotranspiration (ET) is the flux of water from the Earth's surface to the atmosphere. It comprises evaporation as well as transpiration, 
        which is the process of water moving through a plant evaporating from leaves and stems. ET affects water availability and can be an indicator 
        of vegetation health. Using isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen, we conducted end-member splitting analysis (Kirchner and Allen, 2020) to determine how 
        watershed inputs of summer and winter precipitation are split into outputs of runoff and ET. Figure 1 shows an example of a figure describing long-term average partitioning in a watershed (data are 
        simulated since manuscript is in preparation for publication). We're specifically interested in how the fraction of ET sourced from summer precipitation
        varies with summer precipitation amount. However, this method relies on several assumptions that 
        make it unsuitable for analyzing data at the annual timescale.

      <p>The end-member splitting method assumes that all inputs and outputs are accounted for. This becomes problematic at annual timescales because we don't know how much precipitation 
        from previous years is supplying runoff. One way of addressing this is to examine the results under a variety of contradicting assumption and look for consistent trends
        as shown in figure 2. However, trends are rarely consistent and thus are difficult to interpret. Furthermore, this approach ignores another key assumption: that there is no change
        in storage during the sampling period for each data point which, in this case, is one year.

          the year of interested are used to calculate the y-axis value. "Lag 1" means that precipitation isotope values from the previous year are used to calculate the y-axis value. "Mean" 
          means that the long-term average precipitation isotope values are used to calculate the y-axis value. Data are simulated.</figcaption>

      <br>
      <p>Another option is to group years by the amount of summer precipitation and analyze differences between the groups. By grouping
        multiple years, we can assume that changes in storage are negligible compared to total flux amounts. We calculate the weighted 
        average isotope values for each group before calculating the partitioning fractions, so we aren't assuming that all inputs 
        or outputs are confined to a single year. However, this method doesn't show how partitioning changes over a range of values and 
        we were unable to detect many statistically significant differences between the two groups.

      <p>To solve this problem, we developed a bootstrapping numerical solution approach. We replaced every 
        variable in the end-member splitting equations with the linear regression of that variable against the x-axis (
        summer precipitation). We conducted 3000 bootstrapping iterations by repeating this process with random samples 
        of the data, then used the percentiles from those iterations to create figure 4. This figure is preferable compared
        to others because it show a trend across the range of possible summer precipitation amounts, it clearly quantifies 
        uncertainty, and it conforms to the assumptions of the end-member splitting method.
