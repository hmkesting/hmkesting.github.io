        <p>I am a spatial data scientist and landscape ecologist with 5 years of experience working with GIS and remote sensing tools.
          I recently earned an M.S. in Ecology, Evolution, and Conservation Biology from the University of Nevada, Reno. Now I'm pursuing
          a career that will allow me to build upon my analytical skills while working with complex ecological data. My strengths include:
          <br><ul class="bulleted-list">
            <li><strong>Programming in Python and R:</strong> I develop workflows for data cleaning, processing, and analysis. I also 
              generate customizable figures and statistical analyses beyond prepackaged code. </li>
            <li><strong>Spatial Statistics and Modelling:</strong> I conduct variogram analysis and use spatial interpolation methods such as IDW, 
              spline, and kriging. After developing a model, I analyze the spatial and frequency distributions of the residuals to 
              inform decisions about model types, variables, and hyperparameter settings. </li>
            <li><strong>Remote Sensing and Imagery Analysis</strong> I use imagery at a variety of spatial resolutions to classify land cover types and 
              detect changes in vegetation. Using structure from motion photogrammetry, I generate point clouds to analyze vegetation structure.</li> 
            <li><strong>Technical Writing</strong> I think critically about the language I use to efficiently communicate scientific methods and 
              concepts to people from a variety of backgrounds.</li>
          </ul>
        My interest in ecology is inspired by a love of the outdoors. For fun, I enjoy skiing, climbing, backpacking, caving,
        running, and more, but my favorite activity is ski mountaineering. This year, I summited Whitney (pictured left), Shasta, and Rainier.

      <h2>Career Summary</h2>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          I earned my B.S. in Environmental Science and Terrestrial Resource Management from the University of Washington which is
          where I first learned about GIS. I took a class about spatial analysis in forest resources and afterwards, I immediately 
          signed up as a GIS Lab Assistant to teach other students how to find spatial data and take advantage of this incredible 
          technology. For my thesis, I used ArcGIS to classify aerial imagery by land cover type to assess habitat suitability 
          for a native bee species. I worked a number of seasonal jobs that gave me experience with field research in the subject 
          matters of plant-insect interactions, fisheries, disease vector control, and riparian conservation. While I enjoyed my 
          experiences in the field, I knew that I eventually wanted to work on data analytics, so I went back to school to learn 
          technical data science skills such as programming, machine learning, spatial statistics, ecological forecasting, and more 
          (as shown by my <a href="/assets/images/KestingResume.pdf" class="image fit"><img target="_blank">transcripts</a>).
