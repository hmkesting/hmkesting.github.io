        <h1><center>About Me</center></h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p>I am a spatial data scientist and landscape ecologist with 5 years of experience working with GIS and remote sensing tools.
          I recently earned an M.S. in Ecology, Evolution, and Conservation Biology from the University of Nevada, Reno. My interest in ecology 
          is inspired by a love of the outdoors. For fun, I enjoy skiing, climbing, backpacking, caving, running, and more, but my favorite 
          activity is ski mountaineering. This year, I summited Whitney (pictured left), Shasta, and Rainier.

      <h2><center>Career Summary</center></h2>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          I earned my B.S. in Environmental Science from the University of Washington which is
          where I first learned about GIS. After taking a class about spatial analysis in forest resources, I immediately 
          signed up as a GIS Lab Assistant to teach other students how to find spatial data and take advantage of this incredible 
          technology. I worked a number of seasonal jobs that gave me experience with field research in the subject 
          matters of plant-insect interactions, fisheries, disease vector control, and riparian conservation. While I enjoyed my 
          experiences in the field, I knew that I eventually wanted to work in data analytics, so I went back to school to learn 
          technical data science skills such as programming, machine learning, spatial statistics, ecological forecasting, and more 
          (as shown by my <a href="/assets/images/UNRUnofficialTranscript.pdf" class="image fit"><img target="_blank">transcript</a>).
          My master's thesis (manuscript in preparation for submission to peer-reviewed journal) examines spatial and temporal variations
          in ecosystem resistance to seasonal drought. Now, I'm pursuing a career that will allow me to build upon my analytical skills 
          while working with complex ecological data.
