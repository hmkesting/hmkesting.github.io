      <h1><center>Modeling monthly precipitation isotope values with universal kriging</center></h1>
	<p>The goal of this project is to create monthly grids of precipitation isotope values covering the 
	   contiguous U.S. This is the first step of a larger project to analyze precipitation and runoff 
	   isotopes at sites across the country which ultimately addresses questions about ecosystem water 
	   use and vulnerability to seasonal drought. Here, we’ll just walk through the process of kriging 
	   January precipitation isotope values (δ<sup>2</sup>H). The raw data shown below were obtained from 
	   waterisotopes.org.

      <p>Moran’s I statistic showed the presence of spatial autocorrelation with a value of 0.34, meaning 
	that similar values tend to be clustered. I conducted a variogram analysis. I manually limited the 
	maximum range, then fit three variogram models: gaussian (blue), spherical (red), and exponential 
	(yellow). In black, I also plotted the Monte Carlo envelope which shows the upper and lower bounds 
	of a 95% confidence interval based on 1000 permutations of the data. The gaussian and spherical 
	variogram models performed similarly well, but I moved forward with the gaussian model because it 
	had a lower RMSE.

      <p>I kriged the values with elevation as a covariate, then plotted the 5-fold cross validation 
	residuals spatially. There tended to be more negative residuals further north and more positive 
	residuals further south, so I decided to include latitude as a covariate in the model.

	Overall, I created 8 models and the one with the lowest AIC was an additive spatial model with 
	covariates of elevation and latitude. Below is the result of kriging onto a spatial points grid.
